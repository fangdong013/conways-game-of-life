# Conway's game of life visualization
![alt tag](http://www.texample.net/media/tikz/examples/PNG/glider.png)


This is my final project for a MATLAB programming class.
Since my degree has a lot to do with biology, I decided to implement Conway's game of life in MATLAB.

If you don't know what game of life is, [this wikipedia article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life.) is a good place to start.
 
Current functionality:
 + displays a graph of randomly generated cells which abide by 23/3 rules of GoL (by default)
 + the rules can be changed based on two vectors
 + GUI that contains:
   + simulation speed slider
   + rule change option
    + display of generation count

To be implemented:
   + file I/O
   + grid size options
   + color options
